# Commercial Licensing Information

**CC Version Guard** by Zendevve

## Dual Licensing Model

This project uses a **dual licensing approach** that is fully compliant with GPLv3:

### 1. Source Code (Free - GPLv3)

The **source code** of CC Version Guard is **free and open source** under the GNU General Public License v3.0:

✅ **You CAN:**
- View, study, and audit the source code
- Modify the code for your own purposes
- Compile the software yourself for personal use
- Distribute the **source code** under GPLv3 terms
- Create derivative works under GPLv3

📜 **Full terms:** See [LICENSE](LICENSE)

### 2. Pre-Compiled Binaries (Commercial)

**Pre-compiled executables** (.exe, .msi, installers) are **exclusively distributed** by Zendevve:

❌ **You CANNOT:**
- Redistribute the official compiled binaries
- Re-upload them to other platforms
- Sell or share the pre-built executables
- Mirror the release artifacts

✅ **You CAN:**
- Purchase official binaries from authorized channels
- Use purchased binaries on your own devices
- Compile from source for personal use (free under GPLv3)

## Why This Model?

This approach balances **open source principles** with **sustainable development**:

1. **Transparency**: Anyone can audit the code for security/privacy
2. **Freedom**: Technical users can build from source for free
3. **Convenience**: Non-technical users can purchase ready-to-use builds
4. **Sustainability**: Revenue supports ongoing development and maintenance

## Is This Legal Under GPLv3?

**Yes, absolutely.** The GPLv3 license:

- ✅ Permits charging for distribution (Section 4)
- ✅ Allows exclusive binary distribution by the copyright holder
- ✅ Requires source code availability (we provide it freely)
- ✅ Does NOT require free binary distribution

From GPLv3:
> *"You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee."* (Section 4)

## Purchasing Official Binaries

### Where to Buy

Official pre-compiled binaries are available exclusively from:
- **Primary**: [Gumroad Store](https://zendevve.gumroad.com)
- **Alternative**: [GitHub Sponsors Tier](https://github.com/sponsors/Zendevve)

### What You Get

When you purchase a binary license, you receive:

1. **Pre-compiled executable** - No complex build process required
2. **Automatic updates** - Notification of new versions
3. **Priority support** - Faster response to issues
4. **Financial contribution** - Supporting open source development

### What You DON'T Get

Purchasing does **NOT** grant you:
- ❌ Right to redistribute the binary
- ❌ Commercial use rights beyond personal use
- ❌ Modified licensing terms
- ❌ Warranty or guarantees (see [LEGAL_DISCLAIMER.md](LEGAL_DISCLAIMER.md))

### Pricing

- **Individual License**: $9.99 USD (one-time purchase)
  - Lifetime access to your purchased version
  - Updates for that major version (e.g., v1.x)

- **Supporter License**: $19.99 USD (one-time purchase)
  - All Individual License benefits

## Building From Source (Free Alternative)

You can **always** build from source for **FREE** under GPLv3:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zendevve/cc-version-guard.git
cd cc-version-guard
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

**Why purchase instead of building?**

Building requires:
- Windows SDK, Visual Studio Build Tools (several GB)
- Rust toolchain setup and configuration
- Node.js and npm environment
- 30-60 minutes of build time
- Technical knowledge to troubleshoot build errors

**Purchasing gives you:**
- Instant download and installation
- No technical expertise required
- Support for the developer
- More convenient for non-developers

## For Enterprise/Organizational Use

If you wish to:
- Deploy to multiple users in your organization
- Integrate into commercial products
- Resell or bundle with other software

Please contact **business@zendevve.com** for **enterprise licensing** options.
