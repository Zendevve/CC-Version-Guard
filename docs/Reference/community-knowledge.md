## Community Notes / "Cracking"

### Config Lock Method (Matches our implementation)
> "Open Configure.ini... make sure it looks like this: last_version=1.0.0.0... The update.exe and ProductInfo.xml files you created must be set to read-only"

### Recommended Versions
1. **4.0.0**: Stable, track height adjustment, markers. (Drawback: fewer free pro features than 2.9/3.2)
2. **2.9.0 & 3.2.0**: "Most important pro effects and features available for free."
3. **1.5.0**: Offline, clean.

### Issues
- "Network Error" when exporting often means Pro features are used without payment (or crack isn't working).
- Auto-captions are server-side and often break in older versions or cracks.
